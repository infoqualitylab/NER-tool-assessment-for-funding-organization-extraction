Disclosure of funding sources and conflicts of interest in evidence underpinning vitamin D and calcium recommendations in bone health guidelines,9991793,10.1017/S1368980022000246,NA,"Financial support: This work was funded Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) project grant APP1139997 (Bero). The funding source played no role in the conceptualisation, design, analytical methods, data interpretation, reporting of the manuscript or publication decisions. SM is a PhD student funded by the Country Women’s Association (NSW) and Edna Winifred Blackman Postgraduate Research Scholarship.","Our findings show that a large proportion of studies about vitamin D and/or Ca interventions receive government funding. This is encouraging as it challenges notions that government does not adequately fund nutrition research and that nutrition research must rely on industry funding(28). However, the pharmaceutical industry was found to be the main source of commercial funding and author COI. This is problematic for two reasons. First, pharmaceutical industry funding might stimulate researchers to study pharmaceutical interventions rather than food- or sun-based interventions. Thus, the pharmaceutical industry could be driving the bone health research agenda, and subsequent guideline recommendations, by producing an evidence base that is oriented towards supplementation(25). Second, there is existing concern around a focus on supplementation in relation to overprescribing and over testing(9,29–32). For instance, the International Osteoporosis Foundation partnered with DSM, a multi-corporation of health, nutrition and materials and identified a global need for vitamin D supplementation based on claims of widespread deficiency(9,33).",NA
