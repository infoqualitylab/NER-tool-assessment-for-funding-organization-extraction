We thank Wayne England, John Clarkson, Liam Falvey, Michael Fay and Rachel Przeslawski for their help and company in the field. Fieldwork was funded by honorary/visiting professorships from The University of Western Australia and Curtin University to M.W.C. Kingsley Dixon (Curtin University) and Steve Hopper (University of Western Australia, Albany), David Mabberley (Mount Victoria), and Frank Howarth and Peter McCarthy (Sydney) provided advice and logistical support on our collecting trips. Leaf samples of N. fatuhivensis were provided by Kenneth Wood, National Tropical Botanical Garden, Hawai’i. Removal of still viable seeds from herbarium specimens resulted in a much more representative sampling of these species over their ranges, and we thank the curators of the following herbaria for permission to do this: AD, BRI, CANB, NSW, NT, PERTH and K. In particular, we appreciate the advice and assistance afforded us by Peter Jobson (NT), Brendan Lepschi (CANB), Helen Vonow (AD) and Neville Walsh (MEL). Among the tens of sheets from which we removed viable seeds, many were collected by Peter Latz, a well-known and charismatic expert on the plants of central Australia; we thank him for his advice and many collections over nearly 50 years from difficult-to-reach localities. Seeds were imported to the UK and living material grown at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in the Quarantine House with the help/advice of Sara Redstone, who is gratefully acknowledged. Juliane Baar and Daniela Paun are acknowledged for support during RADseq library preparation. Andrew Meade provided advice on BayesTraits usage.","Financial support to prepare the RAD library and analyse data was provided by research grants P 26548-B22 and P33028-B of the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) and an award (Dr. Anton Oelzelt-Newin Foundation) from the ÖAW (Austrian Academy of Sciences), all to R.S.",NA
